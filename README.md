# Overview
Just some demos showing how to write app activity to Google+.

# Usage

To run the demo, you need to set up API access to Google+, configure the app,
and finally run it. More languages will be added over time.

## JavaScript

1. Create a client ID for your application by navigating to:
  https://code.google.com/apis/console

2. Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID  in javascript/index.html with the client Id you 
created.

3. To run the demo, just start up a web server on the appropriate port, for example:

    cd javascript

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
